        The rest of this assignment is not graded and is optional, but it's good practice, so go for it if you have time. The solution to the optional ungraded portion of the assignment below does NOT have to be submitted.

        (OPTIONAL, NOT GRADED) Since in this optional part you will be implementing something more complex than a single section in the Bootstrap grid, remove that section before continuing.

        (OPTIONAL, NOT GRADED) As in previous assignment, the rest of your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. You can make it dummy text/"lorem ipsum", it doesn't matter. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (Hint: use the Bootstrap Grid we discussed in Lecture 26 of Module 2 as well as numerous lectures of Module 3, including Lecture 35.)

        (OPTIONAL, NOT GRADED) Each section should be fairly large in height. You can achieve this by either filling it up with a lot of content text or simply setting its height property to something large like 700px. At the end of each section, provide a link that says "Back to Top". This link should jump the page back to "Our Menu" heading. (Hint: use a link that points to a section of the page discussed in Lecture 9 of Module 1.) End of section. <a href="#head">Back to top</a>
